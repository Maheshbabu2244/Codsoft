Image captioning using deep learning involves recognizing the context of an image and generating descriptive captions through the integration of computer vision techniques and natural language processing (NLP). This process utilizes models trained on annotated datasets, such as the Flickr8k dataset, and includes elements like data preparation and model training. It's a complex task that combines visual recognition with language output to create coherent and contextually relevant descriptions.
What is Image to Caption Generator?
Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning and computer vision. It includes labeling an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. The imagenet dataset trains the CNN model called Xception. Xception is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model, which generates the image caption.
